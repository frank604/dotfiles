# This is an example (nonsense) configuration file for udiskie.

program_options:
  # Configure defaults for command line options

  udisks_version:   2       # [int] Specify the version of udisks
                            # to be used. Set to 0 to use automatic
                            # discovery.

  tray:             auto    # [bool] Enable the tray icon. "auto"
                            # means auto-hide the tray icon when
                            # there are no handled devices.

  automount:        true   # [bool] Enable automatic mounting.

  notify:           true    # [bool] Enable notifications.


  file_manager:     xdg-open
    # [string] Set program to open directories. It will be invoked
    # with the folder path as its # command line first argument.

  password_prompt: ["gnome-keyring-query", "get", "{.id_uuid}"]
    # [string|list] Set command to retrieve passwords. If specified
    # as a list it defines the ARGV array for the program call. If
    # specified as a string, it will be expanded in a shell-like
    # manner. Each string will be formatted using str.format with a
    # Device object as the first argument. For a list of device
    # attributes, see below. The two special string values
    # "builtin:gui" and "builtin:tty" signify to use udiskie's
    # builtin password prompt.


mount_options:
  # List of mount option rules. Only the first matching entry is
  # used. Each item can match any combination of device attributes
  # (see below). Additionally, it must define an 'options' list. An
  # item without any device attributes serves as a catch-all rule.

- id_type: vfat             # match file system type
  options: ro               # list of mount options
- id_uuid: 9d53-13ba        # match by device UUID
  options: [noexec, nodev]  # mount options can be given as list
- id_type: ext4
options: [discard, noatime, flush]


ignore_device:
  # Customize udiskie's ignore rules. This config entry has the
  # same structure as *mount_options*, the only difference being
  # that the action is defined by the 'ignore' field which is a
  # boolean defaulting to true. The rules defined here are simply
  # prepended to the builtin ignore rules, so that it is possible
  # to completely overwrite the defaults by specifying a catch-all
  # rule.

    #- id_uuid:     8d53d27a-2407-444f-9ccd-0e285bfbedf8     # ignore this device
#- device_file: /dev/dm-5
#  ignore:      false        # never ignore this device

notifications:
  # Customize which notifications are shown for how long. Possible
  # values are:
  #   positive number         timeout in seconds
  #   false                   disable
  #   -1                      use the libnotify default timeout

  timeout:          1.5     # set the default for all notifications

  # Specify only if you want to overwrite the the default:
  device_mounted:   5       # mount notification
  device_unmounted: false   # unmount notification
  device_added:     false   # device has appeared
  device_removed:   false   # device has disappeared
  device_unlocked:  -1      # encrypted device was unlocked
  device_locked:    -1      # encrypted device was locked
  job_failed:       -1      # mount/unlock/.. has failed

notification_actions:
  # Define which actions should be shown on notifications. Note that there
  # are currently only a limited set of actions available for each
  # notification. Events that are not explicitly specified show the default
  # set of actions. Specify an empty list if you don't want to see any
  # notification for the specified event:

  device_mounted:   [browse]
  device_added:     [mount]

icon_names:
  # Customize the icon set used by the tray widget. Each entry
  # specifies a list of icon names. The first installed icon from
  # that list will be used.

  media:   [drive-removable-media, media-optical]
  browse:  [document-open, folder-open]
  mount:   [udiskie-mount]
  unmount: [udiskie-unmount]
  unlock:  [udiskie-unlock]
  lock:    [udiskie-lock]
  eject:   [udiskie-eject, media-eject]
  detach:  [udiskie-detach]
  quit:    [application-exit]

      #All keys are optional. Reasonable defaults are used if you leave them
      #unspecified.


      #Device attributes

      #of attributes is currently availabe, but there is no guarantee that they will
